RANGKUMAN TEKNOLOGI CLOUD COMPUTING
===================================
Cloud computing metaphor: the group of networked elements providing services need not be 
individually addressed or managed by users; instead, the entire provider-managed suite 
of hardware and software can be thought of as an amorphous cloud.

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially 
data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. 
The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over 
the Internet. Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over 
multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, 
it may be designated an edge server.

Cloud computing was popularized with Amazon.com releasing its Elastic Compute Cloud product in 2006.[12]

References to the phrase "cloud computing" appeared as early as 1996, with the first known mention in a 
Compaq internal document.[13]

The cloud symbol was used to represent networks of computing equipment in the original ARPANET by as 
early as 1977,[14] and the CSNET by 1981[15]â€”both predecessors to the Internet itself. The word cloud was 
used as a metaphor for the Internet and a standardized cloud-like shape was used to denote a network on 
telephony schematics. With this simplification, the implication is that the specifics of how the end points 
of a network are connected are not relevant for the purposes of understanding the diagram.[citation needed]

The term cloud was used to refer to platforms for distributed computing as early as 1993, when Apple spin-off 
General Magic and AT&T used it in describing their (paired) Telescript and PersonaLink technologies.[16] 
In Wired's April 1994 feature "Bill and Andy's Excellent Adventure II", Andy Hertzfeld commented on Telescript, 
General Magic's distributed programming language:
